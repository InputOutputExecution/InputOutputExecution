# About me
I'm ioexec, I'm a hobbyist programmer and soon to be computer-science student. I started my journey with programming at the age of 10 when I got my hands on a computer for the first time. I spent much of my teens writing little trinkets and studying a variety of different systems I found interesting. I'm passionate about learning and have been focusing on creating new projects to improve my skills as a developer.
Here, you will find various projects I have written that showcase this journey.
